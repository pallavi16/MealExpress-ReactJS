        Whether it's a plate of grilled octopus or fried rabbit: our Italian food is like a 
        collection of stories that arrive at your table, in a bowl or on a plate. 
        Our aim is simple: to honor markets and farms from one season to the next, 
        nurture our cooks and keep a balance in cooking between authenticity and spontaneity.
